#   A Quadratic Problem

This is an example of a slow O(N<sup>2</sup>) algorithm. We're going to replace it with a speedy O(N).
Very often (but not always), when an algorithm nests one loop inside another, the algorithm is O(N<sup>2</sup>).
This is considered a relatively slow algorithm and we must spend some time to consider if there are any faster alternatives.
Sometimes this cannot be achived.
